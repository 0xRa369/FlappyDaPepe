# Flappy DaPepe - Modded Flappy Bird -JavaScript


Flappy Bird was a side-scrolling mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics. I've given it a Pepe-fied facelift along with some interchangable maps and music. 

The objective is to direct Pepe in his DaVinci helicopter, between the pipes. 

If the player touches the pipes, they lose. 

Pepe briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Pepe falls because of gravity; 
each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game. 

No medal is awarded to scores less than ten. 

A bronze medal is given to scores between ten and twenty. Silver medal is 20 points. Finally the gold medal is given to those who score higher than thirty points. 

Players who achieve a score of forty or higher receive a platinum medal. 

There is no variation or evolution in gameplay throughout the game, as the pipes always have the same gap between them and there is no end to the running track, having only the flap and ding sounds and the rising score as rewards.

That being said the game will be upgraded shortly to include a web3 leaderboard allowing users to win weeekly/monthly prize pots.
